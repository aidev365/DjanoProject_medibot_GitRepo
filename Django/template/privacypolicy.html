                  <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;We may collect the following Personal Data relating to you:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li class="child"> <strong>Account Information:</strong> To use our Platform and access the Services, you must first register.

Data that we collect automatically includes your internet protocol (“IP”) address, location, your device’s identification information, and the actions taken on our Platform (e.g., links that you click) as well as other sites that you may visit.
